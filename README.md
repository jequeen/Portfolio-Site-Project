# Portfolio-Site-Project
The portfolio site is the first major project of the Front-End Nanodegree program. The goal was to create a site to display projects I have/will work and promote myself as a web developer.

Students are given a mock-up example site and a project rubric. This repo contains my submission of the project.

The site is hosted [here](https://jequeen.github.io). Alternatively, you can simply clone this repo and open the ‘index.html’ file in your browser.

All images used in this project are public domain images. The logo was created using a free logo creator.
